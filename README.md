# Merged-Datasets!

Worked on 4 different datasets namely - country population, life expectancy, fertility rate and metadata datasets. Cleaned and transformed each dataset using pandas and numpy in google colab. Finally merged all 4 datasets using pd.melt() into a single colab file and perfomed a final data cleaning on the merged dataframe!
